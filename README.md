## Experiment 6 – Applying CI/CD Principles to Web Development Using Jenkins, Git, and Local HTTP Server

### Objective

To implement and demonstrate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles for a web application using Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and a local Python HTTP server.

### Key Concepts

- Git
- GitHub
- Version Control
- Jenkins
- CI/CD
- Jenkins Pipeline
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python HTTP Server
- Automated validation
- Automated testing
- Automated deployment
- Application versioning

### Experiment Description

A static web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Git was used to maintain the source code under version control, while GitHub was used as the remote repository.

Jenkins was configured to obtain the application source code and execute a CI/CD pipeline.

The Jenkins pipeline consisted of the following stages:

```text
Checkout
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Test
   ↓
Deploy
```

The application was deployed using Python's built-in HTTP server and verified through a web browser.

Two application versions were implemented.

Version 1 demonstrated the initial CI/CD workflow.

Version 2 demonstrated application modification, Git version control, committing changes, pushing the updated version to GitHub, and processing the updated source code through Jenkins.

### Outcome

The web application was successfully integrated with Git, GitHub, and Jenkins.

Jenkins successfully checked out the source code, validated the application files, tested the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and deployed the application using a local Python HTTP server.

Version 2 was successfully created, committed, and pushed to GitHub.

The updated application was successfully integrated into the CI/CD workflow.

The application was successfully accessed through:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

The Jenkins pipeline completed successfully with:

```text
Finished: SUCCESS
```
